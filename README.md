| Emoji | Meaning |
|:-----:|---------|
| 🔥 | **Hot Opportunity** - Big Tech, well-funded startup, high compensation, or elite engineering culture. Great for your resume! |
| 💤 | **Likely Boring** - Body shop, staffing agency, legacy maintenance, or low pay. Consider carefully - good for experience but may not be exciting. |
| 🆕 | **Newly Added** - Recently discovered and added to the list. |

> **Tip:** 🔥 roles are competitive but excellent career launchers. 💤 roles can still be valuable for gaining experience, especially as a first job. Most jobs have no emoji - they're solid opportunities that fall in between.
